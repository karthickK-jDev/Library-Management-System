# Library Management System

 • Library management system is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps librarian to maintain the data of new books and the books that are borrowed by members along with their due dates.
 
 • I used live server in this projects to store and retrieve the data  in the database anywhere. 
 
 • It was implemented by using JAVA, SWING and mySQL as the System's Backend.
